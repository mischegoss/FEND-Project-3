## FEND Arcade Game
This is the third project in Udacity FEND's project. It uses [starter code] (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) provided by Udacity.

## How to Play
You can play the game [here](https://mischegoss.github.io/FEND-Project-3/).

Alternatively, you can download the files into a local directory. Then, open the index.html in a web browser of your choice to run the game.

The player is located at the top of the screen. To win, you have to navigate using your keyboard arrows to get across the road to the bottom of the screen without running into any bugs.

If you win, an alert will be triggered and you will have the option to play again.

## Resources

For this project, I used the following resources:
* Matthew Cranford's tutorial (especially for the SWITCH method and math on step size)
* Student Help/Slack (especially for getting the canvas to show up)
* [Ryan Waite's Walkthrough for GwG Program] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_vUG-vi2LY)(especially for the logic of collisions).

## Dependencies

* Starter Code provided by Udacity
